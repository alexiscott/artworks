This is an Online Catalogue Raisonn√©. It is open source and so can be
used by anyone who can run Nix and Haskell locally.

Benefits
- Builds statically, so you can run it on any server that will host
  html files, i.e. GitHub.
- Uses Lunr.js for frontend searching of artworks, so no need to
  configure or run separate search software.

* Install and run
- nix develop
- make -k
